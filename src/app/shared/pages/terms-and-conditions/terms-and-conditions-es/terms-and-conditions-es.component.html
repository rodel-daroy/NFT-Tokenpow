                selltoken Owners are not guaranteed to receive Contributions made to a
                selltoken, even after the selltoken has ended and the fundraising goal
                has been reached. There may be a delay between the end of a selltoken
                and Our remittance of Contributions to a selltoken Owner for a number of
                reasons including, but not limited to, refunds, chargeback disputes,
                fraud, Terms or other policy violations, or any other situation. For

                selltoken Owner violates any Terms (as determined by GoBitFundMe in its
                sole discretion). Additionally, GoBitFundMe may withhold funds pending the receipt and evaluation of information requested through paragraph (j) above or during the pendency of any investigation GoBitFundMe may undertake into your account. If you do not provide information within the requested time or are not able to substantiate claims made in your selltoken, GoBitFundMe may terminate your selltoken and account and avail itself of any remedies available to it under this Agreement or applicable law. GoBitFundMe may also withhold funds from selltoken Owners for any other breach of this Agreement.

                collection services.

                By contributing to a selltoken, Contributors are supporting an idea,
                project, or cause they care about and want to help make happen. Like
                anyone getting in on an early-stage project, Contributors accept the

            </p>
            <p>
              All Disputes shall be resolved before a single arbitrator in accordance
              with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures for claims that
              do not exceed $250,000 and the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and
              Procedures for claims exceeding $250,000, in each case applying the rules
              and procedures in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated,
              excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.
              You can find the JAMS rules and procedures
              <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/adr-rules-procedures/">here at this link</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              To start an arbitration with JAMS, you must do the following: (1) write a
              Demand for Arbitration that includes a description of the claim and the
              amount of damages you seek to recover (you may find a copy of a Demand for
              Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com); (2) send three copies of the Demand for
              Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS, 2 Embarcadero
              Center, Suite 1500, San Francisco, CA 94111; and (3) send three copies of
              the Demand for Arbitration to GoBitFundMe at 965 Mission St, 6th Floor, San
              Francisco, CA 94103, ATTN: Legal Department.
            </p>
            <p>
              You will be required to pay $250 to initiate an arbitration against us. If
              the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, GoBitFundMe will
              pay all other fees invoiced by JAMS, including filing fees and arbitrator
              and hearing expenses. You are responsible for your own attorneys' fees
              unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.

              <strong><em>Location of Arbitration</em></strong>: If you live in the United States, you may initiate and litigate the
              arbitration in your hometown area or through the JAMS office located in San
              Francisco, California. If you live outside the United States, you must
              initiate and litigate the arbitration through the JAMS office located in
              San Francisco, California. Either party may ask that the arbitration
              including the hearings, arguments, and all conferences be conducted
              telephonically or by video conference (<em>e.g., </em>Skype).
            </p>
            <p>
              The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall

              to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these

              limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms, Additional
              Policies, or Privacy Policy is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject

              arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available
              in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be written

              they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They
              further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could
              exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more
              limited in arbitration than in court.

              <strong>CLASS ACTION WAIVER</strong>:
              <strong>
                The parties agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in their
                individual capacities only and not as a class action or other
                representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to
                file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. THIS MEANS THAT
                YOU AND GoBitFundMe AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER
                ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A LEAD OR
                REPRESENTATIVE CLASS PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS
                OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. HOWEVER, THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT
                SEPARATE INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS SHALL BE CONSOLIDATED, UPON REQUEST BY
                EITHER PARTY, IF SUCH SEPARATE INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS RELATE TO OR
                ARISE OUT OF THE SAME OR SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TRANSACTION(S) OR
                OCCURRENCE(S). CONSOLIDATION MEANS THAT ANY AND ALL SEPARATELY
                INITIATED ARBITRATIONS THAT RELATE TO OR ARISE OUT OF THE SAME OR
                SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TRANSACTION(S) OR OCCURRENCE(S) ARE ALL HEARD BY
                A SINGLE ARBITRATOR IN A SINGLE ARBITRATION. IF EITHER PARTY REQUESTS
                CONSOLIDATION OF MULTIPLE ARBITRATIONS, THEN THE PARTIES TO THE
                CONSOLIDATED CASE(S) WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED THEIR RIGHT TO
                DESIGNATE AN ARBITRATOR AS WELL AS ANY CONTRACTUAL PROVISION WITH
                RESPECT TO THE SITE OF THE ARBITRATION. THE FOLLOWING FACTORS MAY BE
                CONSIDERED IN REQUESTING A CONSOLIDATION OF ARBITRATIONS:

                You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and
                class action waiver provisions set forth above.
              </em>
              You can opt out of the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set
              forth above by sending an email from your registered email address on
              GoBitFundMe to us <a href="https://twitter.com/GoBitFundMe1">here</a> with the
              subject line, "ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT." To opt-out,
              you must send the email to GoBitFundMe with the required language within
              thirty (30) days of the later of the following: (i) of your creation of an
              GoBitFundMe account or your first transaction with GoBitFundMe, whichever is
              earlier; or (ii) the date of notice from GoBitFundMe of a material change to
              this Section via email to you. To be clear, if you opt out of the
              arbitration and class action waiver provision, you will be able to pursue
              any potential claims in a court of law<strong><em> and </em></strong>can
              participate in a class action or other class proceeding if you so desire.
              If you do not opt out properly, you agree to arbitrate. If you opt out of
              the arbitration and class action waiver provisions, we will not be subject
              to them either with respect to any disputes with you, meaning GoBitFundMe can
              also litigate in a court of law and be subject to class action litigation.

              If a court or arbitrator decides that any portion of this Section regarding
              Dispute Resolution, Arbitration and Class Action Waiver is invalid or
              unenforceable, then the portion shall be severed from the Terms and/or
              deemed modified, only to the extent necessary to make it lawful. Such
              invalidity shall not affect the enforceability of any other provisions of
              the Terms that are not invalid or unenforceable. To affect the modification
              of the portion, the portion shall be deemed deleted, added to, and/or

              parties as originally expressed herein.
