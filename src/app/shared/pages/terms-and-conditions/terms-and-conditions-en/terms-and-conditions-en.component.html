                    either of us from EEA data subjects regarding personal data,
                    including without limitation, those set forth in Chapter III of the
                    GDPR. The party that receives the data request is responsible for
                    responding to the request. Auction Owner and TokenPow shall
                    reasonably cooperate and assist each other with these requests, to
                    the extent that is legally permissible.

                  <li>
                    Comply with the CCPA as a Business. As a Auction Owner, you will
                    independently fulfill all duties required of “businesses” under the
                    California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), including its
                    implementing regulations. As a “business” under the CCPA, you will,
                    without limitation: (1) provide notices to consumers as required by
                    the CCPA, including providing a privacy policy and a notice of
                    financial incentives, as applicable; (2) respond and honor access
                    and deletion requests of consumers; (3) comply with all CCPA
                    requirements related to the “sale” of personal information, as that
                    term is defined in the statute; (4) implement reasonable security
                    as required by the CCPA; (5) maintain records as required by the
                    CCPA, including records related to your receipt and responses to
                    consumer access and deletion requests; and (6) enter into
                    appropriate contracts with vendors where required by the statute.
                    For clarity, the party that receives a consumer request related to
                    the CCPA is responsible for responding to the request. Auction
                    Owner and TokenPow shall reasonably cooperate and assist each
                    other with these requests, to the extent that is legally
                    permissible.

                <u>Platform Fees</u>. Auction Owners are charged a 2.5% Platform Fee
                as a portion of the funds they raise (the "<strong><em>Platform Fees</em></strong>"). The Platform Fees are
                effective on the date that the Platform Fees are posted and may be
                updated from time to time. Platform Fees will be charged at the

              <li>
                <u>Taxes</u>. Taxing authorities may classify Contributions as taxable income to
                the Auction Owner and any beneficiary who will receive funds directly
                from the applicable Auction. TokenPow may ask for the tax
                identification number (TIN) of Auction Owners and any beneficiaries so
                that We may report taxable income to the relevant taxing authorities.
                TokenPow will provide Auction Owners with a tax document if required
                by the relevant taxing authorities. TokenPow is unable to provide any
                User or third party with tax advice and suggests that such Users or
                third parties consult with tax advisors of their choice. The shipment
                of Perks to Contributors may expose Auction Owners and Contributors to
                sales and use tax obligations.

TokenPow does not guarantee any TokenPows or undertake the duty to investigate or moderate any statements made by a TokenPow Owner (see section 4 below). However, TokenPow may, but is not required to and undertakes no obligation to, request information from TokenPow Owners to investigate possible breaches of this Agreement. The information TokenPow may request includes, but is not limited to, information to support TokenPow statements, evidence that the TokenPow Owner is taking actions to deliver promised products, productions and shipping timelines and information, source documentation to substantiate product claims and TokenPow promises, product prototypes, and personal information to confirm the identity of TokenPow Owners, vendors, and suppliers. You agree that TokenPow may employ third parties to assess the documents and your TokenPow. You agree to provide this information to TokenPow upon request. Failure to provide any of the requested information within 14 days, or a longer time provided by TokenPow in writing, shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.

                <u>TokenPow Reserves the Right to Withhold Funds</u>.
                TokenPow Owners are not guaranteed to receive Contributions made to a
                TokenPow, even after the TokenPow has ended and the fundraising goal
                has been reached. There may be a delay between the end of a TokenPow
                and Our remittance of Contributions to a TokenPow Owner for a number of
                reasons including, but not limited to, refunds, chargeback disputes,
                fraud, Terms or other policy violations, or any other situation. For
                example, TokenPow may withhold Contributions made to a TokenPow if the
                TokenPow Owner violates any Terms (as determined by TokenPow in its
                sole discretion). Additionally, TokenPow may withhold funds pending the receipt and evaluation of information requested through paragraph (j) above or during the pendency of any investigation TokenPow may undertake into your account. If you do not provide information within the requested time or are not able to substantiate claims made in your TokenPow, TokenPow may terminate your TokenPow and account and avail itself of any remedies available to it under this Agreement or applicable law. TokenPow may also withhold funds from TokenPow Owners for any other breach of this Agreement. TokenPow may also seek reimbursement from a TokenPow Owner by any other lawful means, including by using third-party
                collection services.
              </li>

                <u>Refunds</u>. TokenPow does not offer refunds to Contributors at this time.
                Refunds outside of Our Refund Policy must be handled by the TokenPow
                Owner, and TokenPow has no obligation to provide any refunds or become
                involved with any dispute between a TokenPow Owner and Contributor.
                TokenPow reserves the right to terminate User Accounts and remove
                TokenPows for any abuse of our policies.

                By contributing to a TokenPow, Contributors are supporting an idea,
                project, or cause they care about and want to help make happen. Like
                anyone getting in on an early-stage project, Contributors accept the
                risk that the TokenPow may experience changes, delays, and unforeseen
                challenges, or that a TokenPow, and its Perks, might not come to
                fruition. <b>TokenPow does not guarantee or represent that Contributions
                will be used as promised, that TokenPow Owners will deliver Perks, or
                that the TokenPow will achieve its goals. TokenPow undertakes no duty to investigate claims made by TokenPow Owners. TokenPow also does not
                endorse, guarantee, make representations, or provide warranties
                regarding the quality, safety, morality or legality of any TokenPow,
                Perk or Contribution, or the truth or accuracy of any User Content posted
                on the Services.</b> The date to deliver a Perk is an estimate by the
                TokenPow Owner (not TokenPow), and there is no guarantee that the
                TokenPow Owner will fulfill and deliver the Perk by that date. No
                transfer of title to tangible personal property occurs through
                TokenPow.

                <u>Communications Between TokenPow Owners and Contributors</u>. Once you have made a Contribution to a TokenPow, the TokenPow Owners
                may need to contact you to obtain additional information such as
                shipping address, specific preferences for a Perk (for example, color
                or size of a t-shirt), or may ask for feedback on the TokenPow or the
                Perk. In some instances, to receive the Perk, you may need to provide
                requested information within a specific time frame to receive the Perk,
                not doing so may result in your forfeiting the Perk. TokenPow Owners
                should not ask for information that is not required to fulfill a Perk,
                including personal information such as Social Security numbers or
                credit card/banking information. Please contact us <a href="https://twitter.com/TokenPow1">here</a> if you receive a

              sole means to resolve all Disputes, subject to the terms set forth below.
            </p>
            <p>
              All Disputes shall be resolved before a single arbitrator in accordance
              with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures for claims that
              do not exceed $250,000 and the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and
              Procedures for claims exceeding $250,000, in each case applying the rules
              and procedures in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated,
              excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.
              You can find the JAMS rules and procedures
              <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/adr-rules-procedures/">here at this link</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              To start an arbitration with JAMS, you must do the following: (1) write a
              Demand for Arbitration that includes a description of the claim and the
              amount of damages you seek to recover (you may find a copy of a Demand for
              Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com); (2) send three copies of the Demand for
              Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS, 2 Embarcadero
              Center, Suite 1500, San Francisco, CA 94111; and (3) send three copies of
              the Demand for Arbitration to TokenPow at 965 Mission St, 6th Floor, San
              Francisco, CA 94103, ATTN: Legal Department.
            </p>
            <p>
              You will be required to pay $250 to initiate an arbitration against us. If
              the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, TokenPow will
              pay all other fees invoiced by JAMS, including filing fees and arbitrator
              and hearing expenses. You are responsible for your own attorneys' fees
              unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong><em>Location of Arbitration</em></strong>: If you live in the United States, you may initiate and litigate the
              arbitration in your hometown area or through the JAMS office located in San
              Francisco, California. If you live outside the United States, you must
              initiate and litigate the arbitration through the JAMS office located in
              San Francisco, California. Either party may ask that the arbitration
              including the hearings, arguments, and all conferences be conducted
              telephonically or by video conference (<em>e.g., </em>Skype).
            </p>
            <p>
              The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall
              have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating
              to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these
              Terms, Additional Policies, or the Privacy Policy, including but not
              limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms, Additional
              Policies, or Privacy Policy is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject
              to arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct. The
              arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available
              in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be written
              and shall be binding on the parties and may be entered in any court with
              jurisdiction.

            <p>
              The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision,
              they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They
              further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could
              exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more
              limited in arbitration than in court.

                individual capacities only and not as a class action or other
                representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to
                file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. THIS MEANS THAT
                YOU AND TokenPow AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER
                ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A LEAD OR
                REPRESENTATIVE CLASS PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS
                OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. HOWEVER, THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT
                SEPARATE INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS SHALL BE CONSOLIDATED, UPON REQUEST BY
                EITHER PARTY, IF SUCH SEPARATE INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS RELATE TO OR
                ARISE OUT OF THE SAME OR SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TRANSACTION(S) OR
                OCCURRENCE(S). CONSOLIDATION MEANS THAT ANY AND ALL SEPARATELY
                INITIATED ARBITRATIONS THAT RELATE TO OR ARISE OUT OF THE SAME OR
                SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TRANSACTION(S) OR OCCURRENCE(S) ARE ALL HEARD BY
                A SINGLE ARBITRATOR IN A SINGLE ARBITRATION. IF EITHER PARTY REQUESTS
                CONSOLIDATION OF MULTIPLE ARBITRATIONS, THEN THE PARTIES TO THE
                CONSOLIDATED CASE(S) WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED THEIR RIGHT TO
                DESIGNATE AN ARBITRATOR AS WELL AS ANY CONTRACTUAL PROVISION WITH
                RESPECT TO THE SITE OF THE ARBITRATION. THE FOLLOWING FACTORS MAY BE

                You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and
                class action waiver provisions set forth above.
              </em>
              You can opt out of the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set
              forth above by sending an email from your registered email address on
              TokenPow to us <a href="https://twitter.com/TokenPow1">here</a> with the
              subject line, "ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT." To opt-out,
              you must send the email to TokenPow with the required language within
              thirty (30) days of the later of the following: (i) of your creation of an
              TokenPow account or your first transaction with TokenPow, whichever is
              earlier; or (ii) the date of notice from TokenPow of a material change to
              this Section via email to you. To be clear, if you opt out of the
              arbitration and class action waiver provision, you will be able to pursue
              any potential claims in a court of law<strong><em> and </em></strong>can
              participate in a class action or other class proceeding if you so desire.
              If you do not opt out properly, you agree to arbitrate. If you opt out of
              the arbitration and class action waiver provisions, we will not be subject
              to them either with respect to any disputes with you, meaning TokenPow can
              also litigate in a court of law and be subject to class action litigation.

              If a court or arbitrator decides that any portion of this Section regarding
              Dispute Resolution, Arbitration and Class Action Waiver is invalid or
              unenforceable, then the portion shall be severed from the Terms and/or

              invalidity shall not affect the enforceability of any other provisions of

              of the portion, the portion shall be deemed deleted, added to, and/or

              parties as originally expressed herein.
